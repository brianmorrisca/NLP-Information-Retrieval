Keyword-based retrieval: This method is based on searching for specific keywords or phrases in the text. It is simple and efficient, but it may miss relevant information if the keywords are not chosen carefully.

Boolean retrieval: This method is based on using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to combine keywords and search for documents that match the criteria. It can be useful for precise search queries but may not be flexible enough for more complex queries.
