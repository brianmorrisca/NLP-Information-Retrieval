There are several information retrieval methods that are commonly used and are known for their high accuracy. These include:

    Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) - This method uses singular value decomposition to find latent semantic structure in a document set, which can then be used to match queries with relevant documents.
    Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) - This is a generative probabilistic model that is similar to LSI, but it is based on a different mathematical framework. It is used to identify latent topics in a document set, which can then be used to match queries with relevant documents.
    Vector Space Model (VSM) - This method represents documents and queries as high-dimensional vectors, and then uses cosine similarity to measure the similarity between them.
    BM25 - This is a statistical information retrieval model that is based on the probabilistic relevance framework. It is a widely used model for text retrieval and ranking and it is known for its high accuracy.
    Neural Information Retrieval (Neu-IR) - This is a recent method that uses deep neural networks to represent text and match queries with relevant documents. It is known for its high accuracy and ability to handle large and complex data sets.

It is worth noting that these methods are not mutually exclusive, they can also be combined in different ways to create hybrid systems that can improve the accuracy and performance of the retrieval process.
